# AI Coliseum 2023

AI Coliseum is an artificial intelligence competition in Java open to everyone. Individually or as a team, you must implement the strategy for a given game and test your skills against the strategies of other players.

AIC2023 "Home Run" is the game used in the sixth edition of AI Coliseum, in September 2023. Even though I got 7-8th position on the tournament bracket, I won the high school division from students from Catalonia.
I will only **briefly** describe my idea. You can read about the game here: https://coliseum.ai/material?lang=en&tournament=aic2023

## Idea:
In this case, my strategy was not incredibly complex, I just played around a little bit with the ratio of pitchers:batters at the different stages of the game and improved general aspects of my bot. One of the aspects of the code that took the most time was using efficiently the shared memory array to coordinate the troops, as well as building a map to store the bases and stadiums. In the file UnitPlayer.java, one can find a brief description of how I used the memory array.
